# Security Standards

## Authentication and Authorization
- Always use strong authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper authorization checks for all endpoints
- Never hardcode credentials or API keys in source code
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate user permissions before allowing access to sensitive operations

## Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Check input length limits and data types

## Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, SSNs, API keys, tokens)
- Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for external API calls
- Implement proper session management
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

## SQL Injection Prevention
- Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries
- Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries
- Validate and sanitize all database inputs
- Use proper escaping for dynamic SQL construction

## Sensitive Data Handling
- Never log passwords, API keys, tokens, or personal information
- Mask sensitive data in error messages
- Use secure storage for credentials
- Implement proper data retention policies
