/**
 * REST controller providing endpoints for AI-powered code review functionality.
 * 
 * <p>This controller exposes HTTP endpoints that allow clients to submit code for review
 * either as raw unified diff patches or by referencing GitHub pull requests. The controller
 * orchestrates the complete review workflow including diff parsing, parallel reviewer
 * execution, and result aggregation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Available endpoints:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>POST /review/diff - Review a raw unified diff patch</li>
 *   <li>POST /review/pr - Review a GitHub pull request</li>
 *   <li>POST /review/admin/reingest - Admin endpoint to re-ingest standards</li>
 *   <li>POST /review/debug/ai - Debug endpoint for testing AI model</li>
 * </ul></p>
 * 
 * <p>The controller supports both sequential and parallel execution modes, allowing
 * clients to choose between faster parallel processing or more predictable sequential
 * execution for debugging purposes.</p>
